# Comprehensive Team-Based Differential Diagnosis Report

## Executive Summary

A 32-year-old male with HIV (CD4 count 150) presented with a 5-day history of bilateral lower extremity weakness and pain. The acute onset began with right calf pain and weakness, followed by similar symptoms on the left side, progressing to the point where the patient had to crawl to move. History was notable for anorexia, weight loss, travel to India in 2016, alcohol consumption (3-4 beers/day), and smoking. Neurological exam revealed bilateral foot drop. Diagnostic evaluation showed disseminated disease with cavitary lung lesions, widespread lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenic hypodensities, sacral and iliac bone lesions, and EMG confirming lumbosacral plexopathy. Critically, microbiological testing demonstrated MTB PCR and AFB smear positivity on bronchoscopy and lymph node biopsy, establishing the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis in an immunocompromised host.

## Initial Differential Diagnosis from Primary Diagnostician

### Diagnosis 1: Disseminated Tuberculosis with Lumbosacral Plexopathy
**Supporting Findings:**
- Positive MTB PCR and AFB smear from bronchoscopy
- Positive MTB PCR from lymph node biopsy
- MRI showing enhancing marrow-replacing lesions in sacrum and iliac bones
- CT showing cavitary consolidation in left upper lobe with numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules and necrotic lymphadenopathy
- EMG findings consistent with subacute lumbosacral plexopathy
- HIV positive status with CD4 count of 150
- Recent travel history to India (2016), which is a TB-endemic region
- Constitutional symptoms: anorexia and 10-pound weight loss
- Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 63, mildly elevated CRP)
- Bilateral lower extremity weakness with dorsiflexion affected (1/5 strength)
- Pancytopenia (WBC 3.2, platelets 101) suggesting bone marrow involvement

**Opposing Findings or Missing Evidence:**
- Lack of typical back pain that might be expected with vertebral or paraspinal TB involvement
- TB plexopathy is relatively uncommon compared to other neurological manifestations of TB
- No direct evidence of TB involvement of lumbosacral plexus on imaging

### Diagnosis 2: HIV-Related Lymphoma with Lumbosacral Plexus Involvement
**Supporting Findings:**
- HIV positive status with CD4 count of 150 (increased risk for lymphoma)
- Widespread lymphadenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal areas
- Hepatic and splenic hypodensities suggesting infiltrative disease
- Bone lesions in sacrum and iliac bones
- Constitutional symptoms: anorexia and 10-pound weight loss
- Elevated LDH (272), often seen in lymphoma
- Pancytopenia suggesting bone marrow involvement
- Elevated total protein (9.6) with gamma gap (5.8)
- EMG showing lumbosacral plexopathy
- Bilateral lower extremity weakness and pain

**Opposing Findings or Missing Evidence:**
- No tissue biopsy specifically confirming lymphoma
- MTB PCR and AFB smear positivity strongly suggests TB rather than lymphoma
- No CSF findings suggestive of CNS lymphoma
- Lacks typical B symptoms such as night sweats

### Diagnosis 3: HIV-Associated Mononeuropathy Multiplex
**Supporting Findings:**
- HIV positive status with CD4 count of 150
- Bilateral but asymmetric motor deficits (started in right leg then left)
- EMG findings compatible with a plexopathy
- Absence of sensory symptoms
- Foot drop presentation

**Opposing Findings or Missing Evidence:**
- The presence of extensive TB disease provides a more compelling explanation
- Mononeuropathy multiplex typically affects multiple individual nerves rather than a plexus
- Normal CSF findings (no evidence of inflammatory process in CSF)
- Lacks typical sensory complaints often seen in HIV neuropathies

### Diagnosis 4: Paraneoplastic Lumbosacral Plexopathy
**Supporting Findings:**
- Multiple lesions throughout the body suggesting metastatic disease
- Significant weight loss (10 pounds in last month)
- EMG confirming lumbosacral plexopathy
- Elevated liver enzymes (AST 169, ALT 130) and LDH (272)
- Bilateral lower extremity weakness

**Opposing Findings or Missing Evidence:**
- Positive findings for tuberculosis provide a more definitive explanation
- No primary malignancy identified
- HIV with TB is a more parsimonious explanation
- No paraneoplastic antibodies reported

### Diagnosis 5: Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) or CIDP
**Supporting Findings:**
- Bilateral progressive weakness
- EMG showing peripheral nerve involvement
- HIV positive status (which can be associated with higher GBS risk)

**Opposing Findings or Missing Evidence:**
- Normal CSF protein (typically elevated in GBS/CIDP)
- EMG specifically shows plexopathy rather than polyneuropathy
- Presence of significant systemic disease (TB)
- Lack of ascending pattern typical for GBS
- Normal reflexes (typically diminished or absent in GBS/CIDP)

## Critical Review from Diagnostic Reviewer

The Diagnostic Reviewer agreed with the primary diagnosis but recommended important refinements:

1. **Specification of plexopathy etiology**: Acknowledging the plexopathy mechanism could be:
   - Direct invasion of the plexus by TB
   - Parameningeal extension from the sacral/iliac lesions
   - Immune-mediated damage (para-infectious)

2. **Additional contributing factors to consider**:
   - The significant gamma gap (5.8) likely represents polyclonal gammopathy due to chronic HIV and TB infection
   - TB treatment history needs to be clarified to evaluate for possible IRIS
   - Thiamine deficiency may be specifically contributing to neurological symptoms given alcohol use

3. **Additional diagnostic recommendations**:
   - Tuberculostatic drug levels if treatment response is inadequate
   - Vitamin D levels assessment
   - IGRA testing of CSF to evaluate for CNS TB
   - Hepatitis B and C screening, especially given elevated liver enzymes

4. **Treatment considerations**:
   - TB drug resistance testing is essential given origin from India
   - Careful timing of TB treatment and antiretroviral therapy to minimize IRIS risk
   - Consider adjunctive corticosteroids for neurological involvement
   - Consult TB and HIV specialists for optimal management

## Discussion Points and Resolution of Disagreements

Both team members agreed on the primary diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis affecting the lumbosacral plexus in the setting of HIV. The Primary Diagnostician accepted the Diagnostic Reviewer's recommendations for:

1. More specific characterization of the potential mechanisms of TB-related plexopathy
2. Additional diagnostic testing, particularly:
   - Serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation to evaluate the gamma gap
   - TB drug susceptibility testing given the patient's origin from India
   - Comprehensive nutritional assessment including thiamine and vitamin D
   - Hepatitis B and C screening given liver function abnormalities

3. Treatment approach emphasizing:
   - Careful timing of TB and HIV therapies
   - Monitoring for drug resistance
   - Consideration of adjunctive therapies for neurological involvement
   - Specialist consultation

There was no significant disagreement between team members, with both recognizing the complex interplay of TB, HIV, and potential nutritional factors contributing to the clinical presentation.

## Final Consensus Diagnosis

**Primary Diagnosis**: HIV-Associated Disseminated Tuberculosis with Tuberculous Lumbosacral Plexopathy/Radiculitis

**Contributing Factors**:
1. Significant hypergammaglobulinemia (gamma gap 5.8), likely polyclonal due to chronic HIV and TB infection
2. Possible Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) if recently started on antiretrovirals
3. Potential nutritional deficiencies, particularly thiamine, in the context of anorexia and alcohol use
4. Possible hepatic dysfunction related to TB, HIV, and/or alcohol use

## Most Likely Diagnosis

HIV-Associated Disseminated Tuberculosis with Tuberculous Lumbosacral Plexopathy/Radiculitis

This diagnosis is supported by:
1. Definitive microbiological evidence: positive MTB PCR and AFB smear from bronchoscopy and lymph node biopsy
2. Radiographic evidence of disseminated TB: pulmonary cavitary lesions, widespread lymphadenopathy, and osseous involvement
3. EMG confirming lumbosacral plexopathy
4. HIV positive status with CD4 count of 150, creating high susceptibility to disseminated TB
5. Supporting clinical features: constitutional symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and pancytopenia
6. Travel history to TB-endemic region (India)

The neurological symptoms (bilateral foot drop) are most likely explained by tuberculous involvement of the lumbosacral plexus, which may occur through direct invasion, parameningeal extension from adjacent bone lesions, or immune-mediated damage.

## Recommended Next Steps for Diagnosis Confirmation and Treatment

1. **Confirm TB drug susceptibility**:
   - Drug susceptibility testing on TB isolates, especially critical given origin from India where MDR-TB is prevalent

2. **Further characterize contributing factors**:
   - Serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation to evaluate gamma gap
   - Comprehensive nutritional assessment including thiamine, B6, vitamin D, and other micronutrients
   - Hepatitis B and C screening
   - Clarify HIV treatment status and timing relative to symptom onset

3. **Additional neurological evaluation**:
   - Consider MRI neurography for better visualization of lumbosacral plexus
   - IGRA testing of CSF to evaluate for CNS TB involvement
   - If treatment response is suboptimal, consider nerve biopsy

4. **Treatment planning**:
   - Initiate anti-tuberculosis therapy with regimen accounting for potential drug resistance
   - Carefully time antiretroviral therapy to minimize IRIS risk
   - Consider adjunctive corticosteroids for neurological involvement
   - Monitor drug levels if treatment response is inadequate
   - Provide nutritional support and supplementation
   - Implement physical therapy to prevent contractures during recovery

5. **Specialist consultation**:
   - Infectious disease specialists with expertise in TB and HIV
   - Neurology for management of plexopathy
   - Physical medicine and rehabilitation for functional recovery

This comprehensive approach addresses both the primary infectious process and the contributing factors to optimize outcomes in this complex case.
