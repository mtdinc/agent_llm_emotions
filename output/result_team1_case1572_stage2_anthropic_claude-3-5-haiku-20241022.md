# Comprehensive Diagnostic Case Report

## Executive Summary
32-year-old HIV-positive male (CD4: 150) presenting with acute bilateral lower extremity weakness, progressive neurological deficits, and systemic inflammatory findings, with confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

## Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. Tuberculous Polyradiculopathy
2. HIV-Associated Neurological Complications
3. Disseminated Tuberculosis
4. Potential Malignancy
5. Opportunistic Infections
6. Neurological Autoimmune Conditions

## Primary Diagnostic Findings
### Clinical Presentation
- 5 days of bilateral lower extremity weakness
- Acute bilateral leg weakness progression
- Foot drop
- Weakness in dorsiflexion and eversion
- Recent 10-pound weight loss
- History of anorexia

### Key Supporting Evidence
- Positive MTB PCR (bronchoscopy and lymph node biopsy)
- HIV positive with low CD4 count (150)
- Imaging showing:
  * Marrow-replacing lesions
  * Lung lesions
  * Extensive lymphadenopathy
- Laboratory findings:
  * Mild neutropenia
  * Elevated liver enzymes
  * Mildly elevated inflammatory markers

### Epidemiological Considerations
- Moved from India in 2015
- Visited India in 2016 (high TB endemic region)
- Immunocompromised status

## Diagnostic Reasoning
### Most Likely Diagnosis
**Tuberculous Polyradiculopathy with Disseminated Tuberculosis**

#### Rationale
- Confirmed MTB PCR positive
- Classic neurological presentation matching TB neurological involvement
- Immunocompromised status (HIV, low CD4)
- Endemic region exposure
- Systemic inflammatory evidence
- Multi-system involvement (neurological, bone marrow, pulmonary)

## Recommended Diagnostic Confirmation Steps
1. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis
   - TB PCR
   - Cytology
   - Comprehensive viral studies
2. Advanced neuroimaging
   - MRI spine
   - MRI brain
3. Nerve conduction studies/EMG
4. HIV viral load assessment
5. Complete immunological workup
6. Detailed chest CT for comprehensive TB evaluation

## Management Approach
1. Initiate targeted anti-tubercular therapy
2. Optimize HIV management and antiretroviral treatment
3. Neurological rehabilitation
4. Multidisciplinary monitoring
   - Infectious disease
   - Neurology
   - HIV specialist
   - Rehabilitation medicine

## Prognosis Determinants
- Early diagnosis
- Prompt, comprehensive treatment
- Immune system restoration
- Adherence to multi-modal treatment plan

## Potential Complications
- Progressive neurological deficits
- Opportunistic infections
- Treatment-related challenges due to immunosuppression

## Conclusion
A high-suspicion, evidence-based diagnosis of Tuberculous Polyradiculopathy with Disseminated Tuberculosis in an HIV-positive patient, requiring immediate, comprehensive, and coordinated medical intervention.
