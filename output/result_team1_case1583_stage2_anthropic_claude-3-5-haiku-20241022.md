# Comprehensive Medical Case Report

## Executive Summary
60-year-old female with complex medical presentation involving NASH cirrhosis, multiple systemic complications, and progressive clinical deterioration.

## Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. Calciphylaxis (Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy)
2. Disseminated Fungal Infection
3. Thrombotic Microangiopathy
4. Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome
5. Advanced Liver Disease Complications
6. Rare Vasculitic Syndrome

## Primary Diagnosis
**Calciphylaxis (Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy) with Hepatic Decompensation**

### Diagnostic Criteria Supporting Conclusion
- Retiform purpura with eschar formation
- Bilateral thigh soft tissue vascular calcifications
- Abnormal calcium metabolism (PTH: 244 mcg/dL, high 1,25-vitamin D)
- Underlying chronic liver disease (NASH cirrhosis)
- Non-healing skin lesions
- Soft tissue calcifications
- Abnormal coagulation profile
- Persistent systemic inflammatory response

### Pathophysiological Mechanism
- Medial arterial calcification in setting of chronic liver disease
- Metabolic derangements
- Compromised microcirculation
- Inflammatory cascade activation

## Critical Diagnostic Considerations
1. Multisystem involvement
2. Complex metabolic disruptions
3. High risk of progressive organ dysfunction

## Recommended Diagnostic Confirmation Steps
1. Skin and soft tissue biopsy
2. Advanced vascular imaging
3. Comprehensive metabolic panel
4. Endocrine and rheumatologic consultation
5. Specialized inflammatory marker testing

## Prognosis
Guarded to poor, requiring aggressive multidisciplinary management and close monitoring.

## Recommended Immediate Interventions
- Aggressive supportive care
- Pain management
- Wound care
- Nutritional optimization
- Careful medication management
- Potential experimental treatment protocols for calciphylaxis

## Consensus
The diagnostic team unanimously agrees that Calciphylaxis represents the most specific and likely diagnosis, explaining the patient's complex clinical presentation.
