# Comprehensive Clinical Case Report: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

## Executive Summary
20-year-old male with complex psychiatric history presenting with critical neurological and cardiovascular manifestations, diagnosed with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).

## Clinical Presentation
- 20-year-old male with schizophrenia and PTSD
- Multiple psychiatric medications: Risperidone, Benadryl, Thorazine, Olanzapine
- Admitted to psychiatric facility, placed in 4-point restraints
- Presenting symptoms: Agitation, involuntary movements, elevated CK (10,000)
- Abnormal EKG with diffuse ST elevation
- Vitals: HR 125, BP 145/71

## Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (Primary Diagnosis)
2. Malignant Catatonia
3. Serotonin Syndrome
4. Medication-Induced Cardiotoxicity
5. Atypical Antipsychotic Toxicity

## Diagnostic Criteria for NMS
### Classic Triad
- Altered mental status ✓
- Muscle rigidity ✓
- Hyperthermia (subtle) ✓

### Supporting Clinical Markers
- Multiple antipsychotic medication exposure
- Elevated creatine kinase (10,000)
- Autonomic instability
- Neurological symptoms (involuntary movements)

## Diagnostic Confidence
- Probability: 85-90%
- High clinical suspicion based on comprehensive review

## Recommended Immediate Interventions
1. Discontinue all antipsychotic medications
2. Initiate supportive care
3. Consider dantrolene administration
4. Continuous cardiac monitoring
5. Comprehensive metabolic panel
6. Neurological consultation

## Risk Stratification
- High mortality risk if not rapidly addressed
- Requires aggressive multi-disciplinary management
- Close monitoring for potential complications

## Diagnostic Exclusions
- Ruled out:
  * Serotonin Syndrome
  * Malignant Catatonia
  * Severe Infectious Process
  * Exertional Heat Stroke

## Consensus Diagnosis
**Primary Diagnosis: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)**

## Next Diagnostic Steps
1. Confirm NMS diagnosis
2. Rule out cardiac injury
3. Manage metabolic/physiological derangements
4. Provide specialized psychiatric care
