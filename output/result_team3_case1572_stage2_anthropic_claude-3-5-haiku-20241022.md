# Comprehensive Diagnostic Case Report: Disseminated Tuberculous Infection in HIV-Positive Patient

## 1. Executive Summary
32-year-old HIV-positive male (CD4: 150) presenting with acute bilateral lower extremity weakness, multisystem involvement, and confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

## 2. Initial Differential Diagnosis
### Primary Diagnostic Considerations
1. **Disseminated Mycobacterium Tuberculosis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     * Positive MTB PCR and AFB smear in bronchoscopy
     * Marrow-replacing lesions
     * Lung lesions and lymphadenopathy
     * Immunocompromised status (HIV+)
   - **Diagnostic Strength:** HIGHEST PROBABILITY

2. **HIV-Associated Opportunistic Infections**
   - Potential neurological complications
   - Multiple systemic manifestations
   - Low CD4 count increasing infection risk

3. **Neurological Considerations**
   - Subacute lumbosacral plexopathy
   - Foot drop
   - Potential infectious/inflammatory etiology

## 3. Critical Review and Diagnostic Approach
### Diagnostic Confirmation Strategy
- Multi-modal testing approach
- Comprehensive infectious disease evaluation
- Systematic exclusion of alternative diagnoses

## 4. Key Diagnostic Findings
- **Microbiological Evidence:**
  * Positive MTB PCR
  * AFB smear positive
  * Bronchoscopy confirmation

- **Imaging Characteristics:**
  * Marrow-replacing sacral/iliac lesions
  * Lung lesions (left upper lobe)
  * Extensive lymphadenopathy
  * Cavitary lung consolidation

- **Immunological Profile:**
  * HIV positive
  * CD4 count: 150
  * Increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections

## 5. Consensus Diagnosis
**PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:** Disseminated Mycobacterium Tuberculosis with Neurological Involvement in HIV-Positive Patient (Stage 3)

## 6. Recommended Next Steps
1. **Immediate Interventions:**
   - Start comprehensive TB treatment
   - Optimize antiretroviral therapy
   - Neurological rehabilitation
   
2. **Diagnostic Confirmation:**
   - Detailed infectious disease consultation
   - Advanced molecular testing
   - Comprehensive immunological screening

3. **Management Priorities:**
   - Multidisciplinary approach
   - Infectious disease management
   - Neurological rehabilitation
   - Immune system restoration

## 7. Prognosis Considerations
- Early diagnosis critical
- Potential for significant recovery with appropriate treatment
- Close monitoring required
- Comprehensive, aggressive therapeutic approach

## Conclusion
A systematic, evidence-based diagnostic approach confirmed disseminated tuberculous infection as the primary diagnosis, highlighting the complex interplay between HIV immunosuppression and opportunistic mycobacterial infection.
