# Comprehensive Diagnostic Case Report: Disseminated Tuberculosis in HIV Patient

## Executive Summary
32-year-old HIV-positive male (CD4: 150) presenting with acute bilateral lower extremity weakness, systemic tuberculosis, and complex neurological involvement.

## Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. Disseminated Tuberculosis
2. HIV-Associated Malignancy
3. Opportunistic Neurological Infection

## Diagnostic Review Findings

### Primary Diagnosis: Disseminated Tuberculosis (MTB)
#### Microbiological Confirmation
- MTB PCR: Positive
- AFB Smear: Positive
- High mycobacterial load indicating active, widespread infection

#### Systemic Manifestations
- Lumbosacral plexopathy
- Marrow-replacing lesions
- Lung cavitary lesions
- Generalized lymphadenopathy

### Patient Risk Profile
- HIV-positive status
- Severely immunocompromised (CD4: 150)
- High susceptibility to opportunistic infections
- Recent travel history from India (potential TB exposure)

## Diagnostic Certainty
- Clinical Certainty: High (>90%)
- Comprehensive evidence supporting disseminated TB diagnosis

## Diagnostic Criteria Met
1. Positive microbiological tests
2. Multiple systemic involvement
3. Immunocompromised state
4. Consistent clinical presentation
5. Imaging evidence of widespread infection

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Comprehensive TB Treatment
   - Multidrug TB therapy
   - Drug sensitivity testing
   - Molecular resistance screening

2. HIV Management
   - Antiretroviral therapy optimization
   - Viral load monitoring
   - Immune reconstitution assessment

3. Advanced Diagnostic Investigations
   - Whole-body CT/PET scan
   - Spine MRI
   - Detailed lymph node mapping
   - Comprehensive opportunistic infection screening

## Primary Diagnosis
**Disseminated Mycobacterium Tuberculosis with Neurological Involvement in Advanced HIV Disease**

## Prognosis
- Early diagnosis critical
- Aggressive multidisciplinary management required
- Close collaboration between infectious disease and HIV specialists

## Interdisciplinary Management Approach
- Infectious Disease Specialists
- Neurologists
- HIV Care Team
- Rehabilitation Medicine

## Conclusion
A comprehensive, targeted approach addressing both tuberculosis and underlying HIV immunodeficiency is essential for optimal patient outcomes.
